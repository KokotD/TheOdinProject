# The Odin Project

This repository contains my solutions and notes as I work through the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) web development curriculum and learning.

## Structure

- `foundations/` – exercises covering the basics of HTML, CSS, JS, and Git
- `javascript/` – JavaScript exercises and mini-projects
- `projects/` – larger standalone projects

## How to Run

Open any `index.html` file in your browser, or use the Live Server extension in VS Code.

## Notes

- Some tasks include additional test `.js` files.
- I use a custom CSS layout in some projects as extra practice.

## Progress

- [x] Foundations
- [ ] JavaScript
- [ ] Projects
